# SD Task 1: Communication models and middleware

## Implementation 1: direct communication


```bash
cd direct
python .\main.py
```


## Implementation 2: Indirect communication
```bash
cd indirect
python .\main2.py

```
## How It Works
Python will ask you to input the sensors, servers, and terminals you want to use. For example, you could input 2, 3, 4.

If a terminal fails to open correctly, you can manually open it by entering the parameter in the same way that the main program's code does.
